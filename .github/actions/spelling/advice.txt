By default the command suggestion will generate a file named based on your commit. That's generally ok as long as you add the file to your commit. Someone can reorganize it later.

:warning: The command is written for posix shells. You can copy the contents of each `perl` command excluding the outer `'` marks and dropping any `'"`/`"'` quotation mark pairs into a file and then run `perl file.pl` from the root of the repository to run the code. Alternatively, you can manually insert the items...

If the listed items are:
* ... **misspelled**, then please *correct* them instead of using the command.
* ... *names*, please add them to `.github/actions/spelling/dictionary/names.txt`.
* ... APIs, you can add them to a file in `.github/actions/spelling/dictionary/`.
* ... just things you're using, please add them to an appropriate file in `.github/actions/spelling/expect/`.
* ... tokens you only need in one place and shouldn't *generally be used*, you can add an item in an appropriate file in `.github/actions/spelling/patterns/`.

See the `README.md` in each directory for more information.

:microscope: You can test your commits **without** *appending* to a PR by creating a new branch with that extra change and pushing it to your fork. The [check-spelling](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/check-spelling) action will run in response to your **push** -- it doesn't require an open pull request. By using such a branch, you can limit the number of typos your peers see you make. :wink:

:clamp: If you see a bunch of garbage and it relates to a binary-ish string, please add a file path to the `.github/actions/spelling/excludes.txt` file instead of just accepting the garbage.

File paths are Perl 5 Regular Expressions - you can [test](
https://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/perl/) yours before committing to verify it will match your files.

`^` refers to the file's path from the root of the repository, so `^README\.md$` would exclude [README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/main/README.md) (on whichever branch you're using).
